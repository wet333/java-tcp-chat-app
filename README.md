# java-tcp-chat-app

A simple CLI chat application.

<hr>

Hey there! Thanks for checking out this project. 

I’m genuinely excited to see where this chat app can go, and I'm curious to discover what it might turn into with the input of others. Any kind of collaboration is welcome here, whether you want to share ideas, offer feedback, contribute code, or just learn together. 

This is about exploring possibilities and seeing what we can create together. No matter your experience level, I’d love to have you onboard.

### TODO

- Addition of Logout and Unregister handlers.
- On connection, retrieve last chat messages from server.
- Command guide (for client users).
